# Snyk code review exercise

Hello there. You might have been asked to look at this repository and download it. You're currently on the `main` branch, and will need to work on a branch/pull request relavent to the interview you've been invited too.

All exercises are based on the same ticket - [Ticket #5](https://github.com/snyk/snyk-code-review-exercise/issues/5).

We have several flavors of each exercise in different languages, each has a "main" branch with the current state of the application and a "feature" branch that contains changes we'd like you to review.
